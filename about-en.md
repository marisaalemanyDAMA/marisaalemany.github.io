# About me

I’m **Marisa Alemany**, a **Certified Data Management Professional (CDMP)** with more than ten years of experience helping organizations govern, structure, and leverage their data.  

I specialize in **implementing sustainable Data Governance frameworks**, designing **data models aligned with business strategy**, and fostering a **data-driven culture built on value, quality, and trust**.
I have worked on data-driven integrations for national and international telecom companies using Java, C++, TIBCO and IBM tools.
I designed canonical models within Information Architecture frameworks, using hub-based publish-and-subscribe platforms connecting CRMs with legacy systems.
I have also delivered Master Data Management (MDM) projects with Talend and IBM InfoSphere, and developed Information Architectures for large retail and distribution companies.
Additionally, I have led Data Governance and Data Maturity projects for public administrations, technology firms, and healthcare organizations, helping them build sustainable, value-driven data ecosystems.


I combine **technical rigor** with **strategic insight**, helping organizations transform fragmented data into trusted, actionable knowledge.  
I believe in an **ethical, integrative, and practical** approach to Data Management: technology must serve people and purpose.
