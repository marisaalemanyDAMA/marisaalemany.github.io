# Contact

If you would like to **collaborate on a project**, **assess your organization's data maturity**, or **implement a Data Governance framework**, I’d be delighted to hear from you.

I work with public administrations and private companies that aim to **structure, govern, and integrate their data** through a strategic, ethical, and sustainable approach.
